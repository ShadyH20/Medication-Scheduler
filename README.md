# Medication-Scheduler

**Description:**
<br/>An FPGA controlled machine that automatically dispenses the dosage of the prescribed medication at the right time. At the exact time an alerting sound will go on, and when the patient approaches the machine itâ€™ll detect him and will open the slot automatically through a moving device.

A detailed report about the project _"Project Report.pdf"_ is provided.
